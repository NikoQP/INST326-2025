Week 1
Ideally, I avoid getting too involved with AI. I dislike the premise, even as a tool, and am not pleased with its effect on the environment. 
Hopefully, however, these entries will allow me to explore AI with less guilt---given that it's necessary for this class---as well as keep an
open mind. Given my reluctance, however, I ask for forgiveness this first week as I curb my exploration of AI and its uses to current class 
topics.

With that in mind, today I asked ChatGPT to help produce some Python exercises that closely followed the thirty that we were given as an assignment. https://chatgpt.com/share/68c74799-0888-8012-bc6b-1527819ee0b5. 
As far as I am aware, being detailed with your prompts is the bread and butter for most AI tools like GPT. 
Seems I was right to make that assumption. Appreciative as I am of the examples it offered, 
I appreciate more the fact that the tool offers advice or alternatives to its generation. 

Upon reviewing these examples, this initial foray into AI was a success. 
I'll use a few problems GPT spewed out for practice. Maybe I'll ask Gemini or some other AI tool about further problems.
Being able to access plenty of learning models allows me to test and explore how they react differently from one another.
I'm curious as to how people curb these models for database uses, among other tasks.

Week 2
This week I did not, nor did I plan to use AI of any sorts. Next week, I might try Claude to compare it to GPT. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 3
Once again, I did not use any AI this week. I do, however, need to research AI-related tools for an upcoming project, so we'll see an entry next week...hopefully. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 4
Well, I didn't use any AI this week. Another team member handled the research portion above 
while I handled the writing aspect. I digress, this week is also an iffy one, given my packed schedule with all the exams before fall break.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 5
Once again, a victim of exams. I didn't use any AI this week. Schoolwork is eating up most of my
free time. During break, I may have to research some functions/function making. I'll see about
incorporating AI in a useful way then. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 6
I didn't use any AI this week. We'll see about my use in future projects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 7
Using GPT, I asked for guidelines and help detailing and modeling my docstrings for the classes in Project 2.
Honestly, I'm starting to see the light in its use as a tool, despite having to fix multiple errors in structure and formatting.
I can see the usefulness for solo-editors or developers, who may need a cursory glance at their work. GPT especially
helped me catch mistakes or wording errors in my documentation, as I was writing at 3 in the morning. Thanks, GPT!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 9
No AI this week. Exams take time to study for. Might do SQL-related queries later next week, though.
