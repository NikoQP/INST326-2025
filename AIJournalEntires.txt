Week 1
Ideally, I avoid getting too involved with AI. I dislike the premise, even as a tool, and am not pleased with its effect on the environment. 
Hopefully, however, these entries will allow me to explore AI with less guilt---given that it's necessary for this class---as well as keep an
open mind. Given my reluctance, however, I ask for forgiveness this first week as I curb my exploration of AI and its uses to current class 
topics.

With that in mind, today I asked ChatGPT to help produce some Python exercises that closely followed the thirty that we were given as an assignment. https://chatgpt.com/share/68c74799-0888-8012-bc6b-1527819ee0b5. 
As far as I am aware, being detailed with your prompts is the bread and butter for most AI tools like GPT. 
Seems I was right to make that assumption. Appreciative as I am of the examples it offered, 
I appreciate more the fact that the tool offers advice or alternatives to its generation. 

Upon reviewing these examples, this initial foray into AI was a success. 
I'll use a few problems GPT spewed out for practice. Maybe I'll ask Gemini or some other AI tool about further problems.
Being able to access plenty of learning models allows me to test and explore how they react differently from one another.
I'm curious as to how people curb these models for database uses, among other tasks.

Week 2
This week I did not, nor did I plan to use AI of any sorts. Next week, I might try Claude to compare it to GPT. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 3
Once again, I did not use any AI this week. I do, however, need to research AI-related tools for an upcoming project, so we'll see
an entry next week, hopefully.
